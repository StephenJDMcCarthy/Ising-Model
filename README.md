# Ising-Model-Project

Equations.py: This file contains the equations used in the Ising model and the Metropolis Algorithm. It is imported as a module in the files "Statistics.py" and "Images.py".

Statistics.py: This program generates a series of graphs that are used to analyse the phase transition predicted by the 2D Ising model.

Images.py: This program is used to update a lattice of random spins using the Metropolis Algorithm. As each spin is updated, an image of the new lattice is saved to a directory on my computer.

Lattice.sh: This program uses the images generated by "Images.py" in order to create a gif. This gif shows a lattice of random spins being updated one spin at a time.
